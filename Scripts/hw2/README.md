Both part 1 and part 2 on the excercise are writen in the script. When the script is run part 2 will be skipped. To run part 2, put part 1 in comments and uncomment part 2. To uncomment remove the `%{` and `%}` (line 43 and 70) to prevent the MATLAB interpreter to skip the code. 

##Part 1
Creates a supplots of two graphs. The first plot shows the charge on a capacitor in an electrical circuit. First graph ranges from t = 0 to 0.8 witj, q0=10, R=60, L=9, and C=0.00005. A second plot shows a capacitor with 10 times greater charge (C=0.0005) 

## Part 2
Creates a plot displaying the measured data (red diamond shapes) and the expected function (green dashed line). Ranges from 0 to 70 minutes using a a step size of 30 seconds.
